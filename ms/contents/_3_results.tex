\section{Results}


The organize dataset is published on the huggingface dataset repository. It's organized in two formats: YOLO and COCO

\subsection*{Model performance decomposition}

\subsection*{Model size and architecture performance}

\subsection*{Fine-tuned versus. Pre-trained model performance}
- by data configuration
- by sample Size
- by model architecture

\subsection*{External evaluation on the new dataset}

\subsection{Dataset release}
